* The notes directory
  This directory is for notes that may be useful, but aren't complete enough to
  serve as documentation in their current state.

  Think of it as staging for [[../docs]].

** The typegraphs
   The type graph files are derived from a sarif input file, with various options
   controlling output.

   To produce dot maps of a sarif file type graph, from raw (largest) to fully
   filled (most compact):

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd ../data/treeio/2022-02-25

     # Everything:
     ../../../bin/sarif-to-dot -t -d  results.sarif | dot -Tpdf > typegraph-td.pdf

     # Suppress edges to int/bool/string types in dot graph
     ../../../bin/sarif-to-dot -td -n results.sarif | dot -Tpdf > typegraph-tdn.pdf

     # Additionally, only report unique array entry signatures
     ../../../bin/sarif-to-dot -td -nu results.sarif | dot -Tpdf > typegraph-tdnu.pdf

     # Additionally, fill in missing (optional) entries in sarif input before other steps.
     ../../../bin/sarif-to-dot -td -nuf results.sarif | dot -Tpdf > typegraph-tdnuf.pdf

   #+END_SRC
